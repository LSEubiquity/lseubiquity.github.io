# LSE: Layered Structural Encoding

## Unified, bijective canonicalization for text &mdash; optional structural lifting, predictable bytes.

### Why LSE?
Layered Structural Encoding (LSE) is a new open standard for representing text. By separating primitives from structure, it creates compact, deterministic encodings that work across JSON, XML, logs, and more. LSE is bijective and lossless by default.  LSE also supports the ability to canonicalize structures, which makes semantically identical documents become bit-for-bit identical. The result is *less redundancy**, **more efficient processing*, and *cleaner interoperability at web scale*.

### Who is LSE Ubiquity?
LSE Ubiquity is the organization responsible for creating and propagating the Layered Structural Encoding (LSE).
